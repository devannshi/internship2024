Based on the meeting minutes above, generate  meeting summary and a detailed Business Requirement Document (BRD) that includes the following for each functional or non-functional requirement:
    - Assumptions
    - Constraints
    - Dependencies
    - Acceptance criteria
What kind of technical stack makes sense for this requirement?
Can you assess the accuracy % of this Business Requirement Document?
This document is to be generated as a regular TEXT file. It will later be processed further.

However, if any areas of the provided minutes are insufficient for generating an area of the BRD, DO NOT generate the BRD and instead return the following, and ONLY the following:
{
 "INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION": [

   ]
}
i.e. a JSON string with INSUFFICIENT_INFORMATION as the key and a list of the areas lacking information. DO NOT return anything else in this case; it is needed for parsing.
